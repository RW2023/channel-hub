### Benefits of Proper Image Handling

Handling images correctly ensures they:

- **Enhance Readability**: Images break up text and add visual interest.
- **Improve SEO**: Properly tagged images can improve search engine rankings.
- **Ensure Accessibility**: Alt text helps visually impaired users understand image content.

## Example of a Full-Width Image

Sometimes, you may want an image to span the full width of the container. Here’s an example:

<figure className="mb-4">
  <img 
    src="https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600?text=Full+Width+Image" 
    alt="Full-width example" 
    className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg"
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2">
    Full-width images can make a strong visual impact.
